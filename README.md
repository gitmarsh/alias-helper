Tool for managing bash shell aliases
Add and Delete aliases through prompted menu

To use this tool:
1. ~/.bashrc-aliases must be created in your home directory
2. Add:	'source ~/.bashrc-aliases' to your ~/.bashrc file
3. Add an aliaes to reference this tool by executing './nickname' 
	or
   'sudo cp nickname /usr/bin'  (not recommended)

This tool does not directly edit your .bashrc file
Having bash aliases in an independent makes it easy to migrate onto a new setup
